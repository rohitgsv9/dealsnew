            <hr>

            <p class="mtb-15" style="height: auto !important;">If you want to transform a spare room into your own
                personal cinema, you need a dedicated home theater projector. These projectors are specifically meant
                for a room that offers complete light control. One of the major improvements in these projectors over
                entry-level models is the ability to produce much darker blacks, giving you a better contrast ratiothe
                difference between the darkest and brightest parts of an image. Ambient light in your room (windows
                without curtains, for example) washes out the blacks. You can still use a home theater projector during
                the day, provided that you have blackout curtains or shades in the room, but if you cant control the
                light, you lose most of the advantage that these projectors offer over cheaper models, and one of our
                less expensive recommendations is probably a better choice.<br><br>These projectors also work best
                paired with a good projector screen, preferably one with a positive gain (the amount of light reflected
                back to the viewer), rather than a flat-white or gray screen. If you use a wall, the projectors image
                will be 50 to 70 percent dimmer than if you use a proper screen, and HDR wont work well at all. Having
                some gain makes the image brighteralbeit at the expense of viewing anglesand lets you see more HDR
                highlights. All the projectors we reviewed produce enough light to work on screens up to about 130
                inches diagonal, although HDR performance drops a bit on large screens.
            
                           <br><br><p>Similarly, you should
            consider a home theater projector only if you are able to mount it to your ceiling permanently. These models
            are simply too large to fit atop a stool or a coffee table in a living room, and they arent designed to be
            moved around. While entry-level projectors are about the size of a few stacked laptops or textbooks, a home
            theater projector is closer in size to a home theater receiver, so you should place it out of the
            way.<br><br>Projectors designed for a dedicated home theater room dont have any speakers built in, so they
            need a separate sound system. They also have only a pair of HDMI inputs, so you probably need something else
            to switch between sources. Usually these projectors are paired with an AV receiver that handles both of
            those duties, but just keep in mind that you need something to handle sound and input switching for you.
            Also, these projectors have no TV tuners, so if you watch over-the-air broadcasts, you need to get an
            external tuner. </p>

            <h4><b>What makes an awesome home theater projector</b></h4>
            <hr>
            <img src="assets\pan.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;"
                class="img-responsive">
            <p class="mtb-15" style="height: auto !important;">The best projectors have excellent picture quality, but
                what does that mean? There are four elements to a great-looking image: contrast ratio, brightness, color
                accuracy, and color gamut.<br><br>Contrast ratio, or the difference between the darkest part of the
                image and the brightest, is the most important factor when it comes to picture quality. A projector (or
                a TV, for that matter) with a low contrast ratio will appear flat, washed out, and boring. Many new
                projectors support high dynamic range, a feature designed to show a greater range between the brightest
                and darkest parts of the image. To watch HDR video, you need both specially formatted content and a
                projector that can properly play that content.
                
            
                            
                            <br><br>Brightness, also
            called light output on a projector, is crucial. This determines how large of a screen you can have, what
            type of screen you can have (more on this in a moment), and, of course, how bright the image is. Home
            theater projectors dont need to be as bright as a television, as theyre not normally used in bright rooms,
            but higher brightness is beneficial for HDR content.<br><br>Color accuracy refers to how well a projector
            can display the colors on screen to be true to the original content. If the director and cinematographer
            want a shirt to be a specific color when they shoot the movie, a projector with high color accuracy will
            ensure that you see that color on screen. It also ensures that your grayscale (from black to white) is a
            neutral gray and free of color tint.
            
            <br><br>Color gamut refers to
            how many colors a projector can display. Ultra HD content has a wider color gamut than standard HD content;
            right now, most UHD content is mastered with the same DCI/P3 color gamut used in theatrical cinema (the
            ultimate goal is the even larger Rec 2020 color gamut). This expanded color gamut allows a projector to
            display richer reds, blues, and greens than ever before. Many projectors cant display all these shades yet,
            but some can.

            <h4><b>How we picked</b></h4>
            <hr>
            <img src="assets\pan.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;"
                class="img-responsive">
            <p class="mtb-15" style="height: auto !important;">All projectors use one of three technologies to create an
                image: LCD (liquid crystal display), LCoS (liquid crystal on silicon), or DLP (Digital Light
                Processing). DLP offers some advantages over LCD and LCoSnamely, better motion resolution, lower 3D
                crosstalk, and better overall image uniformity. However, LCD and LCoS projectors generally offer higher
                contrast ratios that make DLP projectors look washed out and flat when you view the images side by side.
                (Plus, some people are susceptible to the rainbow effect thats common with inexpensive DLP projectors,
                when bright objects seem to have rainbow trails.) So, while many of our budget projector recommendations
                are DLP-based, LCD and LCoS projectors are usually the better choice for a high-end home
                theater.<br><br>Now that 4K content and playback devices are readily availablein the form of 4K Blu-ray
                players and streaming media devicesour priority has shifted toward home theater projectors that can
                accept and properly display 4K HDR signals, although we also considered some lower-priced 1080p models.
            
            <p>In addition to the
            picture-quality features we describe above, for evaluating 4K projectors, we first considered four basic
            questions:<br><br></p>

            <li>Can the projector display <b>4K resolution</b> on screen?</li>
            <li>Does it support and properly display <b>high dynamic range (HDR) </b>video?</li>
            <li>Can it reproduce the <b>wider color gamut </b>used in Ultra HD content? And if so, how much?</li>
            <li>Does it have <b>full-bandwidth HDMI 2.0b</b> inputs?We wanted any 4K projector we tested to support at
                least three of those features, although some were more important than others.<br><br>Strangely enough,
                whether a projector was true 4K turned out to be the least important feature for overall picture
                quality. Some projectors (such as the JVC DLA-NX5 and Sony VPL-VW295ES) display the full resolution
                natively with a 4K panel; others (such as the Epson 5050UB) use a process called optical shift, where
                they manipulate the output of a 1,920-pixel-wide chip with lenses to produce the image. Both methods
                produce more on-screen detail than you get from a 1080p projector, but they do it in different ways (and
                frankly, most 4K content you can watch these days is already upscaled from a 2K digital master
                anyway).<br><br>More important to the overall 4K picture quality is the projectors ability to accept and
                properly display a videos high dynamic range information. HDR is harder to evaluate on a projector than
                on a TV. Because a projectors brightness depends on many factors, including the size of your screen, the
                throw distance, the screen gain, and the age of the bulb, two people with the same projector can have
                images with very different peak brightness levels. With identical HDR TVs, the peak brightness is the
                same. Projectors have to do far more processing of HDR content because of this, so the quality of HDR
                can vary far more from projector to projector than the quality of an SDR signal might.<br><br>We also
                measured each projector to see how much of the DCI/P3 color gamut it could reproduce. With all the
                projectors we tested, showing the expanded color gamut caused a reduction in brightness, so even if the
                projector supports it, you might not want to enable the wider color gamut.<br><br>Finally, a projector
                needs to have HDMI 2.0b inputs in order to accept a 4K signal with HDR. HDMI 2.0b comes in a couple of
                flavors: 10.2 Gbps and 18.0 Gbps. Most HDR content displays okay at 10.2 Gbps, but some content doesnt
                display at full resolution or at its optimal refresh rate unless you have an 18.0 Gbps connection. So to
                make sure we tested projectors that delivered the best quality for the money, we looked for 18.0 Gbps
                support. <p></p>
